# NFT

NFT stands for "Non-fungible token" and it means that it’s a unique asset and can’t be replaced with something else. Conversely an asset like bitcoin is fungible — trade one for another bitcoin, and you’ll have exactly the same thing. 

NFTs can really be anything digital (such as drawings, music, or other forms of art), but a lot of the current excitement is around the endless possible usecases for this technology in conjuction with dapps on various blockchains. 

An example of NFTs on the IC would be collections like [Motoko Mechs](https://entrepot.app/marketplace/motoko-mechs) created and distributed by Dfinity or our [ICLighthouse Planet Cards](https://tppkg-ziaaa-aaaal-qatrq-cai.raw.ic0.app/market/collection-nft-list?id=goncb-kqaaa-aaaap-aakpa-cai) which offer holders benefits such as a 25% speed up in trade mining competitions. 

NFTs have an uncertain but exciting future and thanks to the ecosystem's countless brilliant and creative developers its likely that in the coming years we'll see the development of powerful usecases for them that we could've never imagined.
